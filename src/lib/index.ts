    /**
     * Custom CSS classes for each diff type (remove, insert, equal).
     *
     * ## Usage
     *
     * Pass an object with keys for each diff type you want to style:
     *
     * ```js
     * rendererClasses={{
     *   remove: 'bg-red-100 text-red-800',
     *   insert: 'bg-green-100 text-green-800',
     *   equal: 'text-gray-700'
     * }}
     * ```
     *
     * - `remove`: CSS class for removed segments (removed text)
     * - `insert`: CSS class for inserted segments (added text)
     * - `equal`:  CSS class for unchanged segments
     *
     * ## Important
     *
     * - **This only works if you do NOT specify the `renderers` prop.**
     *   If you provide custom `renderers`, you are responsible for all rendering and styling.
     * - If a class is not provided for a type, the component will fall back to its default inline style for that type.
     * - This is a convenient way to style the diff output using Tailwind, custom classes, or your own CSS framework.
     *
     * ## Example
     *
     * ```svelte
     * <SvelteDiffMatchPatch
     *   originalText={a}
     *   modifiedText={b}
     *   rendererClasses={{
     *     remove: 'bg-red-100 text-red-800',
     *     insert: 'bg-green-100 text-green-800',
     *     equal: 'text-gray-700'
     *   }}
     * />
     * ```
     *
     * @see renderers for full custom rendering
