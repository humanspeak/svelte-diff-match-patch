### 2. TypeScript Support

- Full TypeScript definitions
- Type-safe component props
- Svelte 5 compatibility with runes
- Strict type checking

### 3. Testing Infrastructure

- Comprehensive unit testing with Vitest
- Coverage reporting
- Browser environment testing with JSDOM
- End-to-end testing with Playwright
    - Cross-browser compatibility validation
    - Visual regression testing
    - Performance benchmarking
    - Accessibility compliance checks
